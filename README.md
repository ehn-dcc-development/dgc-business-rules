## About

The [Digital COVID Certificate (DCC)](https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/coronavirus-response/safe-covid-19-vaccines-europeans/eu-digital-covid-certificate_en) allows to determine whether a person is deemed fit-for-travel into a country-of-arrival (CoA) based on their vaccination, test, and recovery status.
To make such determinations, business (or validation, or verification) rules have to be implemented in verifier apps.

This repository contains a framework to implement (sets of) rules in verifier apps (and backends) using a _rules engine_.
It [explains how to do that](./documentation/how-to.md) in a way that makes these rules interchangeable across implementors.
The advantage of this approach is that it ultimately allows citizens to check their fit-for-travel status into an intended CoA _ahead_ of travel, against the actual rules.
This can be achieved by adhering to a common, and testable and verifiable way of defining, and executing rules.
The interchangeable rules are uploaded to, and can be downloaded from the EU Digital COVID Certificate Gateway (DGCG) - more info can be found [here](./documentation/gateway.md).

An example of a rule can be found [here](documentation/example.adoc).

This work is a result of work done by the EU Taskforce Business Rules, and described in [this document](https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/default/files/ehealth/docs/eu-dcc_validation-rules_en.pdf).
The (JSON Schema) technical specification for the EU DCC can be found [here](https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/default/files/ehealth/docs/covid-certificate_json_specification_en.pdf).
More relevant documents and links can be found [here](./documentation/documents-links.md).


## Assumptions

Various code in this repo assumes that you've cloned the following two repos right next to where this repo's cloned:

* [ehn-dcc-schema](https://github.com/ehn-dcc-development/ehn-dcc-schema)
* [ehn-dcc-valuesets](https://github.com/ehn-dcc-development/ehn-dcc-valuesets)
* ([dgc-testdata](https://github.com/ehn-dcc-development/dgc-testdata))


## Organisation

This repository contains the following:

* [CertLogic](./certlogic/README.md): a specification, reference implementations for various platforms (JavaScript, Kotlin, Dart), a test suite, a validation tool, and a HTML renderer.
  CertLogic is generic, and not tied to the DCC, to make it easier to understand, test, expand, etc. independently.
* [DCC Business Rules Utilities](./dcc-business-rules-utils/README.md): a JavaScript library that contains useful “things” for working with EU DCC business rules.
* [Documentation](./documentation/README.md).
* [JsonLogic](./jsonlogic/): documentation and code relating to JsonLogic.
* [CertLogic editor](./mps/README.md): implemented with MPS.
* [RulesRunner](./rules-runner/README.md): (**deprecated**) implementations of components for running rule(set)s against a DCC payload, for various platforms, including testing.


## Testing & Status

- If you found any problems, please create an [Issue](/../../issues).
- Current status: Work-In-Progress.
